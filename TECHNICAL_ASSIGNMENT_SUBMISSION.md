# JMA Client Knowledge Base Platform - Technical Assignment Submission

## Executive Summary

This submission demonstrates a complete, production-ready implementation of the JMA Client Knowledge Base Platform as outlined in the technical assignment. The system successfully implements all required components:

✅ **Knowledge Base Setup** - PostgreSQL schema with sample clients, stakeholders, and knowledge entries  
✅ **Vector Search & Retrieval** - PGVector integration with semantic search capabilities  
✅ **RAG Pipeline & AI Draft Generation** - LLM-powered content generation with stakeholder tone awareness  
✅ **MS Word Deliverable Generation** - Automated document creation using python-docx  
✅ **Closed-Loop Enrichment** - Learning system that improves with each deliverable  

## Architecture Overview

The platform follows a modern, scalable architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

## 1. Knowledge Base Setup

### Database Schema

The PostgreSQL schema includes all required entities with proper relationships:

```sql
-- Core entities
clients (id, name, industry, description)
stakeholders (id, client_id, name, role, tone, priority_1/2/3)
engagements (id, client_id, name, daaeg_phase)
knowledge_entries (id, client_id, entry_type, content)
deliverables (id, client_id, status, ai_generated_content)

-- Vector storage
knowledge_embeddings (id, knowledge_entry_id, embedding vector(384))

-- Governance
audit_log (id, action, table_name, record_id, old_values, new_values)
```

### Sample Data

The system comes pre-populated with realistic sample data:

**Clients:**
- TechCorp Inc. (Technology, 500+ employees, $50M revenue)
- HealthSolutions Ltd. (Healthcare, patient management systems)

**Stakeholders (6 total):**
- Sarah Johnson (CTO, TechCorp, direct tone, priorities: system modernization, security, cost optimization)
- Michael Chen (VP Engineering, TechCorp, collaborative tone, priorities: team productivity, code quality, innovation)
- Dr. Robert Wilson (CMO, HealthSolutions, strategic tone, priorities: patient safety, clinical efficiency, compliance)

**Knowledge Entries (5 total):**
- Meeting transcripts with detailed technical discussions
- Email communications with budget approvals
- Operational impact assessments
- Clinical requirements gathering

## 2. Vector Search & Retrieval

### PGVector Integration

The system uses PGVector extension for efficient vector operations:

```python
# Vector storage
class KnowledgeEmbedding(Base):
    knowledge_entry_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("knowledge_entries.id"))
    embedding = Column(Vector(384))  # Using sentence-transformers all-MiniLM-L6-v2

# Vector index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_knowledge_embeddings_vector 
ON knowledge_embeddings USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

### Semantic Search Implementation

Three types of search are implemented:

1. **Semantic Search** - Query-based similarity matching
2. **Stakeholder Priority Search** - Based on stakeholder priorities
3. **Hybrid Search** - Combines semantic and priority matching

```python
# Example: Semantic search by keyword
GET /api/search/semantic?query=technology modernization&client_id=1&limit=5

# Example: Search by stakeholder priority
GET /api/search/by-stakeholder-priority?stakeholder_id=1&limit=5

# Example: Hybrid search
GET /api/search/hybrid?query=system modernization&stakeholder_id=1&limit=5
```

### Search Results

The system successfully finds relevant content:
- "technology modernization security" → Returns TechCorp meeting transcripts
- Stakeholder priorities → Returns contextually relevant knowledge entries
- Hybrid search → Combines semantic and priority scores for optimal results

## 3. RAG Pipeline & AI Draft Generation

### Sophisticated Prompt Engineering

The RAG pipeline implements the proposed sophisticated prompt structure:

```python
def _build_rag_prompt(self, client_info, stakeholder_info, knowledge_context, deliverable_type, sections):
    # 1. Ethical guardrails (mandatory)
    ethical_guardrails = """
    ETHICAL GUARDRAILS (MANDATORY):
    - Your primary directive is to be objective and fact-based
    - Do not invent information not present in the provided context
    - Analyze the provided information without bias
    - Avoid loaded, subjective, or stereotypical language
    """
    
    # 2. Client context
    client_context = f"Name: {client_info['name']}, Industry: {client_info['industry']}"
    
    # 3. Stakeholder context with tone
    stakeholder_context = f"Tone: {stakeholder_info['tone']}, Priorities: {stakeholder_info['priority_1']}"
    
    # 4. Knowledge context (retrieved content)
    knowledge_text = "\n\n".join([f"Source: {entry['title']}\nContent: {entry['content']}" 
                                 for entry in knowledge_context])
    
    # 5. Task specification with tone requirements
    task_spec = f"Match stakeholder tone: {stakeholder_info['tone']}"
    
    # 6. Output format specification
    output_format = "Return JSON with requested sections"
```

### Tone-Aware Content Generation

The system adapts content tone based on stakeholder preferences:

- **Direct tone**: "We identified... We recommend..."
- **Collaborative tone**: "Our collaborative analysis revealed... We suggest working together to..."
- **Analytical tone**: "Based on comprehensive analysis... The data indicates..."
- **Strategic tone**: "From a strategic perspective... Long-term implications suggest..."

### Multi-Pronged Retrieval

The system performs sophisticated retrieval:

1. **Structured Query**: Pulls hard facts from PostgreSQL
2. **Semantic Search**: Finds conceptual matches using vector similarity
3. **Priority Matching**: Aligns with stakeholder priorities
4. **Context Filtering**: Focuses on relevant client and engagement data

## 4. MS Word Deliverable Generation

### Document Generation Pipeline

The system creates professional MS Word documents:

```python
def create_deliverable(self, client_name, deliverable_type, content_sections, stakeholder_name):
    # 1. Create document with professional styling
    doc = Document()
    self._setup_document_styles(doc)
    
    # 2. Add header with client and stakeholder info
    self._add_header(doc, client_name, deliverable_type, stakeholder_name)
    
    # 3. Add content sections
    self._add_content_sections(doc, content_sections)
    
    # 4. Add footer with branding
    self._add_footer(doc)
    
    # 5. Save with timestamped filename
    filename = f"{client_name}_{deliverable_type}_{timestamp}.docx"
    doc.save(filepath)
```

### Professional Formatting

Generated documents include:
- **Custom styles**: Title, headings, body text with proper spacing
- **Header section**: Client name, deliverable type, stakeholder, date
- **Content sections**: Executive summary, key recommendations, background, analysis, next steps
- **Footer**: JMA branding and confidentiality notice
- **Professional fonts**: Calibri with appropriate sizing and spacing

### Example Generated Document

The system successfully generates documents like:
- `TechCorp_Inc_Technology_Assessment_20241201_143022.docx`
- `HealthSolutions_Ltd_Patient_Management_System_Upgrade_20241201_143045.docx`

## 5. Closed-Loop Enrichment

### Approval Workflow

The system implements the proposed human-in-the-loop process:

```python
@router.post("/{deliverable_id}/approve")
def approve_deliverable(deliverable_id: int, final_content: str, db: Session):
    # 1. Update deliverable status
    db_deliverable.status = "approved"
    db_deliverable.final_content = final_content
    db_deliverable.approved_at = datetime.now()
    
    # 2. Save approved content as knowledge entry
    approved_entry = KnowledgeEntry(
        client_id=db_deliverable.client_id,
        entry_type="document",
        title=f"Approved {db_deliverable.deliverable_type}: {db_deliverable.title}",
        content=final_content
    )
    
    # 3. Generate embedding for future retrieval
    embedding_vector = embedding_service.generate_embedding(final_content)
    db_embedding = KnowledgeEmbedding(
        knowledge_entry_id=approved_entry.id,
        embedding=embedding_vector
    )
```

### Self-Improving System

The enrichment cycle enables continuous learning:
1. **AI generates draft** → Based on existing knowledge
2. **Human reviews and approves** → Creates "gold standard" content
3. **Approved content becomes knowledge** → Indexed with embeddings
4. **Future generations improve** → Based on approved examples

## API Endpoints
