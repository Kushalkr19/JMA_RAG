-- Schema definition for JMA RAG prototype using PostgreSQL and pgvector.

-- Enable the pgvector extension.  This must be executed once per
-- database before creating the tables.  If you have already enabled
-- the extension you can comment out the following line.
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

-- Drop tables if they already exist (useful for development).
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS knowledge_entries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stakeholders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clients;

-- Clients table: stores organisations.

-- Stakeholders table: associates named individuals with a client.
